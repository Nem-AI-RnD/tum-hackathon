    "question": "How can I control the height of a pattern element in the layout to be a specific size, independent of the drawing scale, in Allplan 2020?",

    "location_dependency_evaluator_target_answer": "You must enter a factor in the pattern parameters. This factor is calculated by dividing the desired height of one pattern element in the layout by the height defined in the pattern defaults.",
    "context": "186 Pattern and scale Allplan 2020 Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is the same at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements doubles. The size is based on the value entered in the pattern defaults and on the width/height factor, which is defined in the pattern parameters. For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 0.10 in the pattern parameters (pattern height x factor = height of one pattern element in the layout). This returns a height of 10 mm (100 mm x 10), regardless of the scale. Representation in document As the number of pattern elements doubles, the way the pattern looks in documents changes dynamically with the reference scale.",

    "faithfulness_eval": "The answer accurately reflects the information provided in the context. The context explains that the size of pattern elements is based on a value in pattern defaults and a width/height factor in pattern parameters. It then provides an example where a desired layout height (10 mm) and a default height (100 mm) lead to a factor of 0.10. The formula given in the context is 'pattern height x factor = height of one pattern element in the layout'. The answer correctly deduces that the factor is calculated by dividing the desired height in the layout by the height defined in the pattern defaults, which is consistent with the example (10mm / 100mm = 0.10). The answer also correctly states that entering a factor in the pattern parameters is the way to control the height."

When you use the selection rectangle, you can specify whether you want to select elements fully bounded by the region, fully bounded and intersected or intersected elements only. The Selection area of the Actionbar and the Filter Assistant toolbar provide the following options: • Selects the elements that are fully bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selects the elements that are partially bounded by the selection rectangle. • Selection depends on the direction in which you enter the selection rectangle: - Entering the region in the positive x-direction selects elements that are fully bounded by the region only. - Entering the region in the negative x-direction selects all the elements that are fully or partially bounded by the region. With this method, the selection rectangle is shown as dashed lines. Note: Select elements based on direction is the default. The selection rectangle is a colored area, which is indicated by the icons. The color of the area changes with the selection option you activate.

Representation in layout The size of the pattern elements is twice as large at 1:50 as at 1:100, but the number of pattern elements remains constant. The size of a single pattern element depends on the following settings: the value in the pattern defaults, the height/width factor specified in the pattern parameters and the scale at which the layout element was placed. For example : You use pattern 301 and the height of one pattern element in the layout should be 10 mm in the layout. In the pattern defaults, a height of 100 mm is defined for pattern 301. Therefore, you must enter a factor of 10 in the pattern parameters (height of a pattern element in the layout = pattern height defined in the defaults x factor x layout scale). At a scale of 1:100, the height is 10 mm (100 mm x 10 x 1/100); at a scale of 1:50, the height is 20 mm.

When printing in batch mode, you can use a fixed print profile for all the layouts or you can use the print profiles saved with the individual layouts. In this case, you can make temporary changes in the print profile of the current layout. Allplan uses the global settings for layouts without print profiles. The print profile you select in the Export PDF Data tool has a higher priority rating than the print profiles saved with the layouts; therefore, this print profile is used for all the PDF files that are created in batch mode. Allplan saves the print profile to the favorite file so that you can also use the print profile in Allplan Exchange Layout Distribution . Printing in batch mode When you have selected several layouts for printing in the Print Layouts tool, these layouts will be printed in batch mode. If a Windows driver is selected for the current layout, you can specify the output device, paper format and print profile you want to use. Thus, you can send some layouts straight to a printer and create print files for the other layouts.

Printing sequence within a document • Sequence in which elements are created or modified: By default, elements are drawn based on the sequence in which they were created or modified. The element you created or modified most recently is always on top, hiding the other elements with the same sequence value. • Display sequence: You can define the display sequence of elements by entering a value between -15 and +16. The elements appear on the screen in accordance with the value set: The greater the value, the further up the element. In other words, the element with the greatest value is on top of all the other elements. If several elements have the same value, the display sequence depends on the sequence in which the elements were created or modified. You can generally place surface elements in the background. New elements are given fixed default values, which you can define in the Options - Desktop environment page - General area - Sequence defaults button. You can modify these values. To do this, right-click an element and choose Format Properties - Sequence on the shortcut menu. As an alternative, select Modify Format Properties - Sequence in the Change task area. Elements from V2003 with the Always on Top format property get the value +12. • Surface elements (hatching, patterns, fills, bitmap areas, OLE elements, XRefs): You can specify whether surface elements behave like other elements (that is, printing based on creation sequence or display sequence) or whether they are to stay in the background.

A SmartPart is a parametric Allplan CAD object that acts according to its own logic, which is independent of the CAD system. By using simple, parametric descriptions, you can turn complex geometries of basic elements into new, independent and intelligent objects. These objects are worked out in great detail, including all Allplan resources that are available by default (line, pen, color, layer, and so on). To model SmartParts, you can use all general options. For example, you can join SmartParts, slice them or subtract them from each other. However, you need to define these options in the relevant objects beforehand.

When you work in Allplan in a project-based manner, a new project is created for each construction project. Technically, a project is a folder; metaphorically speaking, it is a drawer containing the drawing files. An unnamed private project for practice and testing is available to each user. You use the building structure to organize the data of a project. This way, you use hierarchical levels to logically structure a building, thus forming the basis for a Building Information Model (BIM). Each structural level gets drawing files and default planes defining the height of the components belonging to the structural level in question. You can derive and create sections, views and reports directly from the building structure. In addition, you can assemble up to 128 drawing files in a fileset; a project can contain up to 1,000 filesets. A fileset can be placed in a layout with a single command. The actual design and data creation process happens in drawing files. These are the equivalent of the transparencies used in conventional building design. Drawing files can be used to give projects a structure. In IT terms, a drawing file is a conventional file stored on your hard disk.

A plane model contains pairs of default planes. Each pair of planes has a name. The same is true for the lower and upper default planes. The pairs of reference planes in a plane model are equivalent to the stories of a building. You can assign them to the structural levels of the building structure or to individual drawing files. A project can contain several discrete plane models. You can change the height settings of the default planes in the plane model. Any changes made to the height settings are immediately reflected in the drawing files to which you have assigned a default plane from the building model. A plane model must not contain pairs of planes with overlapping height settings with the exception of the pair of planes that defines the minimum and maximum height of the building. You can assign the height settings of a pair of planes to a drawing file or structural level of the building structure. However, you can also use the lower and upper default planes from different pairs of planes. Thus, you can create components across several floors (for example, chimneys). You can also assign default planes that are not associated with the plane model to drawing files. You can even select a custom height for the lower default plane and adopt the upper default plane from a plane model. You can also use plane models without a building structure. In the Options , Plane s page, you can configure the program to display planes in elevation and isometric views.

    "context": "268 IFC interface Allplan 2020 IFC object type You can use the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to change the IFC classification of components. This is particularly important if you cannot find an appropriate Allplan tool to create a component and thus model the component as a 3D object or a user-defined architectural component. Note: Only use the IFC object type attribute if you need it. IFC object type exports the element as a BREP (surface model). Normally, Allplan elements will be assigned automatically to the appropriate IFC classes (walls, columns, .). If the IFC object type assigned matches the native Allplan element type, the program ignores the assignment, trying to transfer the element not as a BRep. This prevents loss of quality during IFC export. Note: IFC export transfers openings in the following components: wall (IfcWall), downstand beam and upstand beam (IfcBeam), column (IfcColumn), slab (IfcSlab), roof (IfcRoof), foundation (IfcFooting), and BuildingElementProxy. If a different IFC object type is assigned to the component (for example, IfcPlate instead of IfcSlab), openings will not be transferred. Use the Modify Attributes tool to assign the IFC object type (IfcObjectType) attribute to this component and select the appropriate IFC classification afterward. The most commonly used 21 IFC elements are predefined and can be selected directly in the drop-down list. If you cannot find the required element, click any entry and enter the name of the missing element at the keyboard. The program saves the new entry, presenting it again the next time you select attributes.
